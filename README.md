# Touring Montana

###What is it?
>This website/concept was created for my assignment in The Iron Yard. It was our first assignment, from scratch, using _Bootstrap_. It was a rather simple design based around traveling a place I have very little knowledge of. It was designed web-first and then moved towards mobile, which is where my struggles came in.

###What does it do?
>I took most of my inspiration from many different websites and came up with an Web-first designed site based around very vibrant and engaging photos with links to many different places. The navigation bar moves you freely around the actual site. The nav and pictures have very simple hover mechanics and all link to something that will better inform the interest of the viewer.

>I had the pictures drop opacity while hovered, but realized quickly I wasn't happy with the brightness/look of the text, so I moved to a text-only hover (while noting that the white text on a white background may be difficult to read, it was moved the best I could to compensate).

###Difficulties
>My biggest difficulty, as I said earlier, was moving it from a web-based site into a mobile. It was a battle finding the correct media breaks to adjust my content, mainly with the "Guide" photo and bio.

###Side-note
> As I learn more about html/css and now Javascript I hope to use this project as my testing ground. This project will be adjusted and redone many times as I hone my skills.
